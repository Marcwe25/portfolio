            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm <strong>Marc Weiss</strong>, a multifaceted professional with a robust background in <strong>3D visualization</strong> and a growing passion for <strong>software development</strong>. With over two decades in 3D visualization at prestigious studios like Ando Studio and Viewpoint, I've honed my skills in architectural visualization, scripting, and debugging in dynamic environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey in software development is marked by an enthusiastic leap from art to technology. As a <strong>Tier 4 Engineer</strong> at Intuit and a graduate of the Java & J2EE Programming Course at John Bryce, I've embraced the challenges of debugging, customer support, and continuous learning. My technical proficiency is complemented by strong analytical skills and a customer-focused approach, ensuring that I deliver solutions that enhance user satisfaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm not just about work; I'm a self-driven, autodidact individual who thrives in dynamic environments and loves to collaborate. When I'm not delving into technological challenges, you might find me exploring new horizons in software development or investing time in personal growth and family.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe in the power of persistence and a can-do attitude. Whether it's an independent Maxscript and Python project or spearheading the visualization department, I bring the same dedication and creativity to every endeavor. As I pivot towards software development, I'm excited to blend my artistic vision with coding expertise to contribute uniquely to future projects.
            </p>
            <p>
